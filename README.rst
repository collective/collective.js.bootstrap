About Twitter Bootstrap

Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and 
easier web development.

By nerds, for nerds: Built Twitter by @mdo and @fat, Bootstrap utilizes LESS CSS,
is compiled via Node, and is managed through GitHub to help nerds do awesome
stuff on the web.
Made for everyone.

Made for everyone: Bootstrap was made to not only look and behave great in the latest desktop
browsers (as well as IE7!), but in tablet and smartphone browsers via
responsive CSS as well.

JavaScript plugins, typography, form controls, and even a web-based Customizer
to make Bootstrap your own.
